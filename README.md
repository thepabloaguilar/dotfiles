# Special Thanks

Many thanks to [bruno-delfino1995](https://github.com/bruno-delfino1995), that showed to me this wonderful trick with .dotfiles and provided a shell script to put .dotfiles in their right place.

Thanks to the best subreddit, [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/), I was inspired in many posts and reuse some files from there to make these dotfiles.
